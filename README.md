South Palo Alto Food Closet UI mockup

This is a front-end only, hi-fi v1 prototype for the South Palo Alto Food Closet website.  It was developed as a project for my Web Design class at UC Berkeley in Spring 2014.  It is implemented in pure HTML, CSS, Javascript (including jQuery frameworks).  Revision/commit history is untracked but the files are added here for portfolio growth's sake.
